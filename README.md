TWiLight Menu++ is an open-source DSi Menu upgrade/replacement, and frontend for nds-bootstrap for DSi, 3DS, and flashcards.

# Compiling

Compiling this app requires devkitPRO with devkitARM and libnds. Be sure you have grit and mmutil installed.

## Using Docker

Using the included [Docker](https://docker.com) image, you can easily compile TWiLight Menu++ without having to manually set up the required version of devkitARM using the provided PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts.

The script accepts `make` arguments as well. For example, `.\compile_docker.ps1 clean` will clean the directories of all the compiled code. If you would like to build all artifacts, run `.\compile_docker.ps1 package`.

Please note that Docker compilation is not compatible with native compilation on Windows. You should run `.\compile_docker.ps1 clean` to clean the artifacts before attempting to build with Docker. If a notification appears asking you to share your drive, you must choose to enable drive sharing for Docker to work on Windows.
