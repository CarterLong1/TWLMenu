# ![TWiLightMenu++](https://github.com/RocketRobz/TWiLightMenu/blob/master/logo.png)
TWiLight Menu++ is an open-source DSi Menu upgrade/replacement, and frontend for nds-bootstrap for DSi, 3DS, and flashcards.

# Building

Building this app by yourself requires devkitPRO with devkitARM and [RocketRobz libnds fork](https://github.com/RocketRobz/libnds). Make sure that grit and mmutil are installed.

# Building with Docker

TWiLight Menu++ comes included with a Docker image for easy building without having to manually set up the required version of devkitARM.

## Building with Docker for Windows users.

You can compile TWiLight Menu++ with Docker using the provided PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts. First, install docker at http://docker.com, and [configured Shared Drives](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stevelasker/2016/06/14/configuring-docker-for-windows-volumes/) for the drive where DSiMenu++ is cloned. 

Then run `compile_docker.ps1` in a PowerShell window. The script accepts `make` arguments as well, for example `.\compile_docker.ps1 clean`. Note that Docker compilation is not compatible with native Windows compilation. You should run `.\compile_docker.ps1 clean` to clean the artifacts before attempting to build with Docker.

To build all artifacts, run `.\compile_docker.ps1 package`.
